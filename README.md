### What I learned

I learnt the `image-set()` CSS function to serve multiple resolutions of the same background image.

```css
.element {
  background-image: image-set(
    "images/my-image.webp" 1x,
    "images/my-image@2x.webp" 2x,
    "images/my-image@3x.webp" 3x,
    "images/my-image@4x.webp" 4x
  );
}
```
